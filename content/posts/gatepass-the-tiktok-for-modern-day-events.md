*Why experience, energy, and video now drive event attendance*

I’ve spent some time thinking about why people choose to attend certain events and ignore others. On the surface, it’s easy to assume content is the main driver—who’s speaking, what’s on the agenda, or what value people will get. But the more events I’ve attended and observed, the more I’ve realised that something else plays an equally important role: **how the event feels**.

GatePass, in many ways, is our response to this realisation. I often describe it as *the TikTok for modern-day events*, and that comparison usually raises eyebrows. What I mean by that is simple: a significant part of event attendance is influenced by atmosphere and energy—how an event is perceived before it even happens. People are naturally drawn to experiences that feel alive, engaging, and worth their time. This isn’t just a hunch; there are articles and studies that support this behaviour.

People don’t attend events purely for content. They attend for the experience that surrounds it.


## Why Video Matters

Video makes that experience visible. It allows potential attendees to get a sense of what they’re signing up for, reducing uncertainty and making the decision to attend feel easier and more exciting.

In a short span—sometimes just **30 to 60 seconds**—a well-captured event video can communicate things that paragraphs of text simply can’t, such as:

- the overall vibe of the event
- the type of audience that shows up
- the energy in the room
- the quality of previous editions

These were exactly the ideas we had in mind when we started building **GatePass**.


## What We Set Out to Do

At its core, we set out to do three simple things:

1. Curate better user experiences
2. Help organisers drive event attendance and sign-ups, which eventually lead to sales
3. Do all of this at a price that feels reasonable and accessible

## The Problem with Traditional Event Promotion

Most event promotion today still leans heavily on static posters, long captions, and text-heavy descriptions. While these formats serve a purpose, they often fall short of answering the most important question on a potential attendee’s mind:

> *What will this event actually feel like?*

A poster can tell you what’s happening. A flyer can tell you when and where. But neither can convincingly communicate atmosphere, energy, or the dynamics of a crowd. When that gap exists, people hesitate. They postpone decisions or simply move on to something else.


## The GatePass Approach

GatePass was built around the idea that event discovery should be **experience-first**, not information-first. Instead of asking people to imagine what an event might be like, we show them.

Short-form video gives organisers the ability to capture real moments—laughter, applause, movement, interaction—and present them in a way that feels honest and immediate. This aligns naturally with how people already consume content today, especially on platforms like TikTok and Instagram.

In that sense, GatePass doesn’t try to create a new behaviour. It simply fits into one that already exists.


## Why Video-First Works

Video removes friction from decision-making. When someone can quickly see:

- the kind of crowd an event attracts
- the energy in the room
- how previous editions unfolded

the decision to attend no longer feels like a gamble.

For organisers, this means attracting people who genuinely resonate with the event. For attendees, it reduces the chances of unmet expectations.


## Looking Ahead

As attention spans continue to shrink and competition for people’s time increases, events that rely solely on static promotion will find it harder to stand out. The future of event discovery feels increasingly **visual**, **dynamic**, and **experience-led**.

GatePass exists to support that shift—helping organisers tell their story more clearly and allowing attendees to choose experiences that truly resonate with them.

Events, after all, are no longer just about content. They’re about connection, energy, and shared moments. GatePass is our attempt to bring those moments forward—**before the event even begins**.
