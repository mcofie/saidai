description: "A brief introduction to my new blog space."
---

Welcome to my new writing space. I've designed this blog to be as minimal as possible, stripping away everything that doesn't matter to focus on the content.

No heavy frameworks, no complex build steps—just pure HTML and CSS. This ensures the site remains incredibly fast and accessible.

## What to expect

I'll be sharing my thoughts on:

* Software Architecture & Engineering
* Product Design in the African context
* Experiments and "Tinkering"

## Code Example

Here is a snippet of how this site is built:

```javascript
const build = () => {
  console.log("Building static site...");
  // Ultra-fast build process
};
```
