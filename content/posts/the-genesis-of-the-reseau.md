I’m often amazed at how casual meetups can spark the birth of incredible ideas and initiatives.

Anyone who knows me well will recognise one thing about me: I’m almost always thinking about building. Whether it’s digital products, business ideas, or something in between, my mind tends to gravitate towards creation. It often feels safe for people to bounce ideas off me because there’s a good chance I’ve thought about something similar before, or at the very least, I can help refine the idea.

A simple hangout with a couple of friends reinforced this belief and validated a long-standing thought I’d had: the need for a space that enables builders to thrive, learn, and grow together.

For a long time, I’ve yearned for a strong builder or maker community in Ghana 🇬🇭. I’ve seen the role these communities play in many Western ecosystems and the impact they’ve had in shaping innovation and collaboration. I waited far too long for something similar to emerge locally, and as the saying goes, *build the future you want to see*. I finally took that to heart.

On **11th December 2025**, we hosted our first **[Sandbox Réseau](http://sandboxreseau.com/)** meetup at the **Google Accra AI Community Lab**. The room was filled with people in tech, some already building products and others aspiring to start.

The call to action was simple:

> **Sandbox Réseau is a community of builders.**  
> It brings together builders, thinkers, and makers shaping the next wave of innovation in Africa. It celebrates connection, collaboration, and creation. Developers, designers, founders, and product enthusiasts come together to share work, showcase prototypes, and learn from practical lessons in the open.

The feedback from the first meetup was largely positive, alongside a few honest critiques that we’re committed to improving on. The format itself was intentionally simple. We had open conversations around AI, its impact on our work as engineers, and how it’s reshaping the way we build.

Participants took turns demoing their products and received thoughtful, constructive feedback from the room.

What stood out to me most was how necessary this kind of space truly is. A community where builders can openly share what they’re working on, talk candidly about their process, and receive feedback without the pressure of investors, panels, or polished pitches. Just builders, learning from each other in a judgement-free environment.

Before I sign off, I want to restate the essence of this initiative.

Sandbox Réseau exists to build a community of builders, changemakers, and thinkers who are not just talkers, but doers. With each meetup, we aim to move this mission forward, one conversation at a time.

There’s a lot lined up for **[2026](https://luma.com/sandbox-reseau)**. For now, I’ll get back to the work of turning this into a truly meaningful community.
