I’m often amazed at how a casual meetup can lead to the birth of incredible ideas and initiatives.

Anyone close enough would recognise one thing about me: I’m always brooding with ideas and thinking about building be it digital products, business ideas, or anything in between. It feels safe to bounce ideas off me because I’ve probably thought about them before, or at the very least, I can help refine them.

A hangout with a couple of my friends solidified this notion and validated the need to foster or create a space that enables builders to thrive, learn, and grow.

I’ve always longed for a builder or maker community in Ghana 🇬🇭. I can appreciate the essence of these communities and the impact they’ve had in many Western societies. I waited far too long, so as the saying goes, build the future you want to see and I took heed.

On 11th December 2025, we held our first meetup at the Google Accra AI Community Lab. In attendance were people in tech, either already building a product or aspiring to build one. The call to action was simple: Sandbox Réseau is a community of builders. It brings together builders, thinkers, and makers shaping the next wave of innovation in Africa. It celebrates connection, collaboration, and creation. Developers, designers, founders, and product lovers share work, showcase prototypes, and learn from practical lessons in the open.

Feedback from the very first meetup was mostly positive, alongside a few “not-so-good” ones which we’ll work on. The format was simple: conversations around AI, its impact on our world as engineers, and how it’s changing the way we work. We took turns demoing our products and received constructive feedback and insightful perspectives.

What I observed at the meetup was quite surreal. We really need a community like this one where builders can openly share what they’re working on, give firsthand insight into their process, and receive constructive feedback. A space where people can demo or talk about their product without being judged through the lens of investors or panels completely pressure-free.

Before I sign off, let me reiterate the essence of this initiative: we want to build a community of builders, changemakers, and thinkers who are not just talkers, but doers. In subsequent meetups, we’ll continue to move this motion forward one meetup at a time.

There’s a lot lined up for next year (2026). Off I go to make this a super community.
