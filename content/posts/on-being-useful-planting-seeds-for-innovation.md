The final message attributed to Scott Adams has left me pondering for days. It is a powerful admonition that touches on religion, relationships, and, most importantly, purpose. More specifically, it speaks to usefulness, making an impact in the world, and legacy, which I believe is a natural consequence of being useful.

On the subject of usefulness and impact, this has long been my primary motivation in life. Knowing that you are moving the needle or making a difference, in any form, gives life a certain energy.

If you have ever met me or spoken with me, you will quickly realise that I am, **without apology, an optimist**. I am very much what people describe as a “glass half-full” person. I tend to look for the bright side of things. I believe that what keeps us moving forward as human beings is hope—the belief that something, anything, can be better in the foreseeable future.

Scott, at 68, seemed to believe he had lived a fulfilling life. I meet many young people like myself, aged 33 and under, who dream of a future that works and is shaped by their own actions. Like Scott, I often see problems everywhere and find myself wondering how they might be solved.

From my perspective in Africa, this is especially common. I believe **problems are the raw material of innovation** and as such our posture as a people should be geared towards solving or fixing them.

A simple example comes from my friend Chisom. One day, after a work call, I asked a question I often ask when meeting people: *“What are you working on?”* He spoke for nearly twenty minutes about his passions and aspirations. I was genuinely excited by what he shared. Along the way, there were the usual moments of hesitation: “That’s a good idea, but maybe not now,” or “What if you tried this instead?”

What I did not realise at the time was that I was planting a seed that I would later get to help nurture. Nearly a year later, Chisom came back to share what had grown from that conversation.

**Why am I sharing this? Simply to make a point.**

We are only here for a while, so we might as well make it count. I encourage people to try things.

* Build the app.
* Start the business.
* Run the event.
* Show up fully.

That is how I try to live my life. You never know what an idea, product, or venture might become. But you can only find out if you try.

Scott may not have lived the longest life, and that is true of many people who have left a lasting mark on the world. In the end, what matters is the impact you have made and how fulfilled you feel when the race is over.
